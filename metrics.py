'''
The program has to provide differents metrics when successful :
    - Total number of state ever selected in the open set 
        (complexity in time)
    - Maximum number of states ever represented in memory at the same time
        during the search (complexity in size)
    - Number of moves required to go from the starting state to the goal state
    - Ordered sequence of states that make up the solution
    -
