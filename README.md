## About
42 School project that has us coding an program to solve a Sliding Puzzle game (jeu de Taquin) as efficiently as possible.

## How it works
The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle ("taquin" in French) game using the A* search algorithm or one of its variants.

We start with a square board made up of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty, the others will contain numbers, starting from 1, that will be unique in this instance of
the puzzle.

The search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the final state, a.k.a the "snail solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle.

We must implement at least 3 heuristic functions, with one of them being the Manhattan-distance.

## Usage
